# Vibepollo Fleet Launcher

A simple tool to configure multiple instances of [@Nonary/Vibepollo](https://github.com/Nonary/Vibepollo) for streaming multi monitor mode, mainly targeting desktop use case where multi devices like android tablets can be used as Plug and play external monitor.

> [!Note]
> Vibepollo is an AI-enhanced fork of [Apollo](https://github.com/ClassicOldSong/Apollo) and is a drop-in replacement for it: it installs into the same `C:\Program Files\Apollo` folder, ships the same `sunshine.exe`, and registers the same `ApolloService`. Just install Vibepollo normally and point the launcher's **Vibepollo** folder field at it.

This is the same concept of my old [Multi-streaming-setup](https://github.com/drajabr/My-Sunshine-setup) scripts, with ease of GUI and Auto Configuration, bundled with necessary binaries for Android clients stuff.
